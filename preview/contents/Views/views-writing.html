   <h1 class="title topictitle1">Writing views</h1>

   
   <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">During the view creation process,
      the output structure, field order, content, and any summary or grouping
      information desired in the view is defined.</p>

      <p class="p">The fundamentals of a view are straightforward. A view creates a perspective on the data
         stored in your Couchbase buckets in a format that can be used to represent the data in a
         specific way, define and filter the information, and provide a basis for searching or
         querying the data in the database based on the content. </p>

      <p class="p">Views achieve this by defining an output structure that translates the stored JSON object
         data into a JSON array or object across two components, the key and the value. This
         definition is performed through the specification of two separate functions written in
         JavaScript. The view definition is divided into two parts, a map function and a reduce
         function:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
         <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Map function</strong></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">As the name suggests, the map function creates a mapping between the input data (the JSON
         objects stored in your database) and the data as you want it displayed in the results
         (output) of the view. Every document in the Couchbase bucket for the view is submitted to
         the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function in each view once, and it is the output from the
            <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function that is used as the result of the view.</p>

      <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function is supplied two arguments by the views processor. The
         first argument is the JSON document data. The optional second argument is the associated
         metadata for the document, such as the expiration, flags, and revision information.</p>

      <p class="p">The map function outputs zero or more ‘rows’ of information using an
            <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> function. Each call to the <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> function is
         equivalent to a row of data in the view result. The <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> function can be
         called multiple times within the single pass of the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function. This
         functionality enables you to create views that may expose information stored in a compound
         format within a single stored JSON record, for example generating a row for each item in an
         array.</p>

      <p class="p">You can see this in the figure below, where the name, salary and city fields of the stored
         JSON documents are translated into a table (an array of fields) in the generated view
         content.</p>

      <ul class="ul">
         <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reduce function</strong></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">The reduce function is used to summarize the content generated during the map phase. Reduce
         functions are optional in a view and do not have to be defined. When they exist, each row
         of output (from each <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> call in the corresponding
            <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function) is processed by the corresponding
            <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> function.</p>

      <p class="p">If a reduce function is specified in the view definition it is automatically used. You can
         access a view without enabling the reduce function by disabling reduction (
            <samp class="ph codeph">reduce=false</samp> ) when the view is accessed.</p>

      <p class="p">Typical uses for a reduce function are to produce a summarized count of the input data, or
         to provide sum or other calculations on the input data. For example, if the input data
         included employee and salary data, the reduce function could be used to produce a count of
         the people in a specific location, or the total of all the salaries for people in those
         locations.</p>

      <p class="p">The combination of the map and the reduce function produce the corresponding view. The two
         functions work together, with the map producing the initial material based on the content
         of each JSON document, and the reduce function summarizing the information generated during
         the map phase. The reduction process is selectable at the point of accessing the view, you
         can choose whether to the reduce the content or not, and, by using an array as the key, you
         can specifying the grouping of the reduce information.</p>

      <p class="p">Each row in the output of a view consists of the view key and the view value. When
         accessing a view using only the map function, the contents of the view key and value are
         those explicitly stated in the definition. In this mode the view will also always contain
         an <samp class="ph codeph">id</samp> field which contains the document ID of the source record (i.e. the
         string used as the ID when storing the original data record).</p>

      <p class="p">When accessing a view employing both the map and reduce functions the key and value are
         derived from the output of the reduce function based on the input key and group level
         specified. A document ID is not automatically included because the document ID cannot be
         determined from reduced data where multiple records may have been merged into one. Examples
         of the different explicit and implicit values in views will be shown as the details of the
         two functions are discussed.</p>

      <p class="p">You can see an example of the view creation process in the figure below.</p>

      <div class="fig fignone">
            <img class="image" src="../images/view-building.png" width="480" alt="">
         </div>

      <p class="p">Because of the separation of the two elements, you can consider the two functions
         individually.</p>

      <p class="p">For information on how to write map functions, and how the output of the map function
         affects and supports searching.</p>

      <p class="p">View names must be specified using one or more UTF–8 characters. You cannot have a blank
         view name. View names cannot have leading or trailing whitespace characters (space, tab,
         newline, or carriage-return).</p>

      <p class="p">To create views, you can use either the Admin Console View editor, use the REST
         API for design documents, or use one of the client libraries that support view management.</p>

      
      
      
      
      
      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Map functions</h2><p class="p">The map function is the most critical part of any view
            as it provides the logical mapping between the input fields of the individual objects
            stored within Couchbase to the information output when the view is
            accessed.</p>
<p class="p">Through this mapping process, the map function and the view provide:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><p class="p">The output format and structure of the view on the bucket.</p>
</li>

            <li class="li"><p class="p">Structure and information used to query and select individual documents using the
                  view information.</p>
</li>

            <li class="li"><p class="p">Sorting of the view results.</p>
</li>

            <li class="li"><p class="p">Input information for summarizing and reducing the view content.</p>
</li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Applications access views through the REST API, or through a Couchbase client
            library. All client libraries provide a method for submitting a query into the view
            system and obtaining and processing the results.</p>
<p class="p">The basic operation of the map
            function can be seen in the figure below.</p>

         
         <div class="fig fignone">
               <img class="image" src="../images/views-basic-overview.png" width="480" alt="">
            </div>

         <p class="p">In this example, a map function is taking the Name, City, and
            Salary fields from the JSON documents stored in the Couchbase bucket and mapping them to
            a table of these fields. The map function which produces this output might look like
            this:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">function(doc, meta)
{
  emit(doc.name, [doc.city, doc.salary]);
}
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">When
            the view is generated the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function is supplied two arguments for
            each stored document, <samp class="ph codeph">doc</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">meta</samp> :</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">doc</samp></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The stored document from the Couchbase bucket, either the JSON or binary content.
            Content type can be identified by accessing the <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp> field of the
               <samp class="ph codeph">meta</samp> argument object.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">meta</samp></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The metadata for the stored document, containing expiry time, document ID, revision
            and other information.</p>
<p class="p">Every document in the Couchbase bucket is submitted to the
               <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function in turn. After the view is created, only the
            documents created or changed since the last update need to be processed by the view.
            View indexes and updates are materialized when the view is accessed. Any documents added
            or changed since the last access of the view will be submitted to the
               <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function again so that the view is updated to reflect the
            current state of the data bucket.</p>
<p class="p">Within the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function
            itself you can perform any formatting, calculation or other detail. To generate the view
            information, you use calls to the <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> function. Each call to the
               <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> function outputs a single row or record in the generated view
            content.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> function accepts two arguments, the key and
            the value for each record in the generated view:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">key</em></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The emitted key is used by Couchbase Server both for sorting and querying the
            content in the database.</p>
<p class="p">The key can be formatted in a variety of ways, including
            as a string or compound value (such as an array or JSON object). The content and
            structure of the key is important, because it is through the emitted key structure that
            information is selected within the view.</p>
<p class="p">All views are output in a sorted order
            according to the content and structure of the key. Keys using a numeric value are sorted
            numerically, for strings, UTF–8 is used. Keys can also support compound values such as
            arrays and hashes. </p>

         <p class="p">The key content is used for querying by using a combination of
            this sorting process and the specification of either an explicit key or key range within
            the query specification. For example, if a view outputs the <samp class="ph codeph">RECIPE
               TITLE</samp> field as a key, you could obtain all the records matching ‘Lasagne’ by
            specifying that only the keys matching ‘Lasagne’ are returned.</p>

         
         <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><em class="ph i">value</em></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The value is the information that you want to output in each view row. The value
            can be anything, including both static data, fields from your JSON objects, and
            calculated values or strings based on the content of your JSON objects.</p>
<p class="p">The
            content of the value is important when performing a reduction, since it is the value
            that is used during reduction, particularly with the built-in reduction functions. For
            example, when outputting sales data, you might put the <samp class="ph codeph">SALESMAN</samp> into
            the emitted key, and put the sales amounts into the value. The built-in
               <samp class="ph codeph">_sum</samp> function will then total up the content of the corresponding
            value for each unique key.</p>
<p class="p">The format of both key and value is up to you. You can
            format these as single values, strings, or compound values such as arrays or JSON. The
            structure of the key is important because you must specify keys in the same format as
            they were generated in the view specification.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp>
            function can be called multiple times in a single map function, with each call
            outputting a single row in the generated view. This can be useful when you want to
            supporting querying information in the database based on a compound field. For a sample
            view definition and selection criteria.</p>

         <p class="p">Views and map generation are also very forgiving. If you elect to
            output fields in from the source JSON objects that do not exist, they will simply be
            replaced with a <samp class="ph codeph">null</samp> value, rather than generating an error.</p>
<p class="p">For
            example, in the view below, some of the source records do contain all of the fields in
            the specified view. The result in the view result is just the <samp class="ph codeph">null</samp>
            entry for that field in the value output.</p>

         
         <div class="fig fignone">
            <img class="image" src="../images/views-basic-overview-missing.png" width="480" alt="">
            </div>

         <p class="p">You should check that the field or data source exists during
            the map processing before emitting the data.</p>
<p class="p">To better understand how the map
               function works to output different types of information and retrieve it, see View and Query Pattern
               Samples. </p>

      </div>

      
      
      
      <div class="section" id="topic38908__reduce-functions"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reduce functions</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Often the information that you are searching or
            reporting on needs to be summarized or reduced. There are a number of different
            occasions when this can be useful. For example, if you want to obtain a count of all the
            items of a particular type, such as comments, recipes matching an ingredient, or blog
            entries against a keyword.</p>
<p class="p">When using a reduce function in your view, the value
            that you specify in the call to <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> is replaced with the value
            generated by the reduce function. This is because the value specified by
               <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> is used as one of the input parameters to the reduce
            function. The reduce function is designed to reduce a group of values emitted by the
            corresponding <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> function.</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, reduce can be used
            for performing sums, for example totalling all the invoice values for a single client,
            or totalling up the preparation and cooking times in a recipe. Any calculation that can
            be performed on a group of the emitted data.</p>
<p class="p">In each of the above cases, the raw
            data is the information from one or more rows of information produced by a call to
               <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp>. The input data, each record generated by the
               <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> call, is reduced and grouped together to produce a new record
            in the output.</p>
<p class="p">The grouping is performed based on the value of the emitted key,
            with the rows of information generated during the map phase being reduced and collated
            according to the uniqueness of the emitted key.</p>
<p class="p">When using a reduce function the
            reduction is applied as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">For each record of input, the corresponding reduce function is applied on the row,
               and the return value from the reduce function is the resulting row.</li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">For example, using the built-in <samp class="ph codeph">_sum</samp> reduce function, the
               <samp class="ph codeph">value</samp> in each case would be totaled based on the emitted
            key:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
{
   "rows" : [
      {"value" : 13000, "id" : "James", "key" : "James" },
      {"value" : 20000, "id" : "James", "key" : "James" },
      {"value" : 5000,  "id" : "Adam",  "key" : "Adam"  },
      {"value" : 8000,  "id" : "Adam",  "key" : "Adam"  },
      {"value" : 10000, "id" : "John",  "key" : "John"  },
      {"value" : 34000, "id" : "John",  "key" : "John"  }
   ]
}
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">Using
            the unique key of the name, the data generated by the map above would be reduced, using
            the key as the collator, to the produce the following
            output:</p>

         
         <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
{
   "rows" : [
      {"value" : 33000, "key" : "James" },
      {"value" : 13000, "key" : "Adam"  },
      {"value" : 44000, "key" : "John"  },
   ]
}
</code></pre>

         
         <p class="p">In
            each case the values for the common keys (John, Adam, James), have been totalled, and
            the six input rows reduced to the 3 rows shown here.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><p class="p">Results are grouped on the key from the call to <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> if
                  grouping is selected during query time. As shown in the previous example, the
                  reduction operates by the taking the key as the group value as using this as the
                  basis of the reduction.</p>
</li>

            <li class="li"><p class="p">If you use an array as the key, and have selected the output to be grouped during
                  querying you can specify the level of the reduction function, which is analogous
                  to the element of the array on which the data should be grouped. </p>
</li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The view definition is flexible. You can select whether the reduce function is
            applied when the view is accessed. This means that you can access both the reduced and
            unreduced (map-only) content of the same view. You do not need to create different views
            to access the two different types of data.</p>
<p class="p">Whenever the reduce function is called,
            the generated view content contains the same key and value fields for each row, but the
            key is the selected group (or an array of the group elements according to the group
            level), and the value is the computed reduction value.</p>

         
         <p class="p">Couchbase includes the following built-in reduce functions: </p>

         <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">_count</samp></li>

            <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">_sum</samp></li>

            <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">_stats</samp>.</li>

         </ul>

         
         <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can also write your own custom reduction functions.</div>

         
         
         <p class="p">The reduce function also has a final additional benefit. The
            results of the computed reduction are stored in the index along with the rest of the
            view information. This means that when accessing a view with the reduce function
            enabled, the information comes directly from the index content. This results in a very
            low impact on the Couchbase Server to the query (the value is not computed at runtime),
            and results in very fast query times, even when accessing information based on a
            range-based query.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> function is designed to reduce
            and summarize the data emitted during the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> phase of the process.
            It should only be used to summarize the data, and not to transform the output
            information or concatenate the information into a single structure.</p>
<p class="p">When using a
            composite structure, the size limit on the composite structure within the

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Handling re-reduce</h2>
         <p class="p">For <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> functions, they
            should be both transparent and standalone. For example, the <samp class="ph codeph">_sum</samp>
            function did not rely on global variables or parsing of existing data, and didn’t need
            to call itself, hence it is also transparent.</p>
<p class="p">In order to handle incremental
            map/reduce functionality (i.e. updating an existing view), each function must also be
            able to handle and consume the functions own output. This is because in an incremental
            situation, the function must be handle both the new records, and previously computed
            reductions.</p>
<p class="p">This can be explicitly written as
            follows:</p>

         
         <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>f(keys, values) = f(keys, [ f(keys, values) ])
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This
            can been seen graphically in the illustration below, where previous reductions are
            included within the array of information are re-supplied to the reduce function as an
            element of the array of values supplied to the reduce function.</p>

         
         
         <div class="fig fignone"><img class="image" src="../images/custom-rereduce.png" width="600"></div>

         
         <p class="p">That is, the input of a reduce function can be not only the
            raw data from the map phase, but also the output of a previous reduce phase. This is
            called <samp class="ph codeph">rereduce</samp>, and can be identified by the third argument to the
               <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp>. When the <samp class="ph codeph">rereduce</samp> argument is true, both
            the <samp class="ph codeph">key</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">values</samp> arguments are arrays, with the
            corresponding element in each containing the relevant key and value. I.e.,
               <samp class="ph codeph">key[1]</samp> is the key related to the value of
            <samp class="ph codeph">value[1]</samp>.</p>

         
         <p class="p">An example of this can be seen by considering an
            expanded version of the <samp class="ph codeph">sum</samp> function showing the supplied values for
            the first iteration of the view index
            building:</p>

         
         <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>function('James', [ 13000,20000,5000 ]) {...}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">When
            a document with the ‘James’ key is added to the database, and the view operation is
            called again to perform an incremental update, the equivalent call
            is:</p>

         
         <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>function('James', [ 19000, function('James', [ 13000,20000,5000 ]) ]) { ... }
</code></pre>

         <p class="p">In
            reality, the incremental call is supplied the previously computed value, and the newly
            emitted value from the new
            document:</p>

         
         <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>function('James', [ 19000, 38000 ]) { ... }
</code></pre>

         
         <p class="p">Fortunately,
            the simplicity of the structure for <samp class="ph codeph">sum</samp> means that the function both
            expects an array of numbers, and returns a number, so these can easily be
            recombined.</p>
<p class="p">If writing more complex reductions, where a compound key is output,
            the <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> function must be able to handle processing an argument of
            the previous reduction as the compound value in addition to the data generated by the
               <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> phase. For example, to generate a compound output showing both
            the total and count of values, a suitable <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> function could be
            written like
            this:</p>

         
         <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>function(key, values, rereduce) {
  var result = {total: 0, count: 0};
  for(i=0; i &lt; values.length; i++) {
    if(rereduce) {
        result.total = result.total + values[i].total;
        result.count = result.count + values[i].count;
    } else {
        result.total = sum(values);
        result.count = values.length;
    }
  }
  return(result);
}
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Each
            element of the array supplied to the function is checked using the built-in
               <samp class="ph codeph">typeof</samp> function to identify whether the element was an object (as
            output by a previous reduce), or a number (from the map phase), and then updates the
            return value accordingly.</p>
<p class="p">Using the sample sales data, and group level of two, the
            output from a reduced view may look like

         <p class="p">Reduce
            functions must be written to cope with this scenario in order to cope with the
            incremental nature of the view and index building. If this is not handled correctly, the
            index will fail to be built correctly.</p>

         
         <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> function is
            designed to reduce and summarize the data emitted during the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp>
            phase of the process. It should only be used to summarize the data, and not to transform
            the output information or concatenate the information into a single
            structure.</p>
<p class="p">When using a composite structure, the size limit on the composite
            structure within the <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> function is
            64KB.</p>

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Views on non-JSON data</h2><p class="p">If the data stored within your buckets is not
            JSON formatted or JSON in nature, then the information is stored in the database as an
            attachment to a JSON document returned by the core database layer.</p>
<p class="p">This does not
            mean that you cannot create views on the information, but it does limit the information
            that you can output with your view to the information exposed by the document key used
            to store the information.</p>
<p class="p">At the most basic level, this means that you can still
            do range queries on the key information. For
            example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">function(doc, meta)
{
    emit(meta.id, null);
}
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">You
            can now perform range queries by using the emitted key data and an appropriate
               <samp class="ph codeph">startkey</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">endkey</samp> value.</p>
<p class="p">If you use a
            structured format for your keys, for example using a prefix for the data type, or
            separators used to identify different elements, then your view function can output this
            information explicitly in the view. For example, if you use a key structure where the
            document ID is defined as a series of values that are colon
            separated:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">OBJECTYPE:APPNAME:OBJECTID
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">You
            can parse this information within the JavaScript map/reduce query to output each item
            individually. For
            example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">function(doc, meta)
{
    values = meta.id.split(':',3);
    emit([values[0], values[1], values[2]], null);
}
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">The
            above function will output a view that consists of a key containing the object type,
            application name, and unique object ID. You can query the view to obtain all entries of
            a specific object type
            using:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">startkey=['monster', null, null]&amp;endkey=['monster','\u0000' ,'\u0000']

      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">View writing best practice</h2><p class="p">Although you are free to write views
            matching your data, you should keep in mind the performance and storage implications of
            creating and organizing the different design document and view definitions.</p>
<p class="p">You
            should keep the following in mind while developing and deploying your views:</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quantity of Views per Design Document</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Because the index for each map/reduce combination within each view within a given
            design document is updated at the same time, avoid declaring too many views within the
            same design document. For example, if you have a design document with five different
            views, all five views will be updated simultaneously, even if only one of the views is
            accessed.</p>
<p class="p">This can result in increase view index generation times, especially for
            frequently accessed views. Instead, move frequently used views out to a separate design
            document.</p>
<p class="p">The exact number of views per design document should be determined from
            a combination of the update frequency requirements on the included views and grouping of
            the view definitions. For example, if you have a view that needs to be updated with a
            high frequency (for example, comments on a blog post), and another view that needs to be
            updated less frequently (e.g. top blogposts), separate the views into two design
            documents so that the comments view can be updated frequently, and independently, of the
            other view.</p>
<p class="p">You can always configure the updating of the view through the use of
            the <samp class="ph codeph">stale</samp> parameter. You can also configure different automated view update times for
            individual design documents</p>

         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Modifying Existing Views</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If you modify an existing view definition, or are executing a full build on a
            development view, the entire view will need to be recreated. In addition, all the views
            defined within the same design document will also be recreated.</p>
<p class="p">Rebuilding all the
            views within a single design document is an expensive operation in terms of I/O and CPU
            requirements, as each document will need to be parsed by each views
               <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> functions, with the resulting
            index stored on disk.</p>
<p class="p">This process of rebuilding will occur across all the nodes
            within the cluster and increases the overall disk I/O and CPU requirements until the
            view has been recreated. This process will take place in addition to any production
            design documents and views that also need to be kept up to date.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Don’t Include Document ID</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">The document ID is automatically output by the view system when the view is
            accessed. When accessing a view without reduce enabled you can always determine the
            document ID of the document that generated the row. You should not include the document
            ID (from <samp class="ph codeph">meta.id</samp> ) in your key or value data.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Check Document Fields</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Fields and attributes from source documentation in <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp> or
               <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp> functions should be checked before their value is checked
            or compared. This can cause issues because the view definitions in a design document are
            processed at the same time. A common cause of runtime errors in views is missing or
            invalid field and attribute checking.</p>
<p class="p">The most common issue is a field within a
            null object being accessed. This generates a runtime error that will cause execution of
            all views within the design document to fail. To address this problem, you should check
            for the existence of a given object before it is used, or the content value is checked.
            For example, the following view will fail if the <samp class="ph codeph">doc.ingredient</samp> object
            does not exist, because accessing the <samp class="ph codeph">length</samp> attribute on a null object
            will
            fail:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
function(doc, meta)
{
    emit(doc.ingredient.ingredtext, null);
}
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">Adding
            a check for the parent object before calling <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> ensures that the
            function is not called unless the field in the source document
            exists:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
function(doc, meta)
{
  if (doc.ingredient)
  {
     emit(doc.ingredient.ingredtext, null);
  }
}
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">The
            same check should be performed when comparing values within the <samp class="ph codeph">if</samp>
            statement.</p>
<p class="p">This test should be performed on all objects where you are checking the
            attributes or child values (for example, indices of an array).</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">View Size, Disk Storage and I/O</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Within the map function, the information declared within your
               <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> statement is included in the view index data and stored on
            disk. Outputting this information will have the following effects on your
            indexes:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">* *Increased index size on disk* — More detailed or complex key/value combinations
  in generated views will result in more information being stored on disk.

* *Increased disk I/O* — in order to process and store the information on disk,
  and retrieve the data when the view is queried. A larger more complex key/value
  definition in your view will increase the overall disk I/O required both to
  update and read the data back.
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">The
            result is that the index can be quite large, and in some cases, the size of the index
            can exceed the size of the original source data by a significant factor if multiple
            views are created, or you include large portions or the entire document data in the view
            output.</p>
<p class="p">For example, if each view contains the entire document as part of the
            value, and you define ten views, the size of your index files will be more than 10 times
            the size of the original data on which the view was created. With a 500-byte document
            and 1 million documents, the view index would be approximately 5GB with only 500MB of
            source data.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Including Value Data in Views</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Views store both the key and value emitted by the <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp>. To
            ensure the highest performance, views should only emit the minimum key data required to
            search and select information. The value output by <samp class="ph codeph">emit()</samp> should only
            be used when you need the data to be used within a <samp class="ph codeph">reduce()</samp>.</p>
<p class="p">You
            can obtain the document value by using the core Couchbase API to get individual
            documents or documents in bulk. Some SDKs can perform this operation for you
            automatically. </p>
<p class="p">Using this model will also prevent issues
            where the emitted view data may be inconsistent with the document state and your view is
            emitting value data from the document which is no longer stored in the document
            itself.</p>
<p class="p">For views that are not going to be used with reduce, you should output a
            null
            value:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
function(doc, meta)
    {
    if(doc.type == 'object')
    emit(doc.experience, null);
    }
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">This
            will create an optimized view containing only the information required, ensuring the
            highest performance when updating the view, and smaller disk usage.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Don’t Include Entire Documents in View output</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">A view index should be designed to provide base information and through the
            implicitly returned document ID point to the source document. It is bad practice to
            include the entire document within your view output.</p>
<p class="p">You can always access the
            full document data through the client libraries by later requesting the individual
            document data. This is typically much faster than including the full document data in
            the view index, and enables you to optimize the index performance without sacrificing
            the ability to load the full document data.</p>
<p class="p">For example, the following is an
            example of a bad
            view:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
function(doc, meta)
    {
    if(doc.type == 'object')
    emit(doc.experience, doc);
    }
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">The
            above view may have significant performance and index size effects.</p>
<p class="p">This will
            include the full document content in the index.</p>
<p class="p">Instead, the view should be
            defined
            as:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
function(doc, meta)
    {
    if(doc.type == 'object')
    emit(doc.experience, null);
    }
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">You
            can then either access the document data individually through the client libraries, or
            by using the built-in client library option to separately obtain the document data.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Using Document Types</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">If you are using a document type (by using a field in the stored JSON to indicate
            the document structure), be aware that on a large database this can mean that the view
            function is called to update the index for document types that are not being updated or
            added to the index.</p>
<p class="p">For example, within a database storing game objects with a
            standard list of objects, and the users that interact with them, you might use a field
            in the JSON to indicate ‘object’ or ‘player’. With a view that outputs information when
            the document is an
            object:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code><samp class="ph codeph">```
function(doc, meta)
{
  emit(doc.experience, null);
}
```
</samp></code></pre>
<p class="p">If
            only players are added to the bucket, the map/reduce functions to update this view will
            be executed when the view is updated, even though no new objects are being added to the
            database. Over time, this can add a significant overhead to the view building
            process.</p>
<p class="p">In a database organization like this, it can be easier from an
            application perspective to use separate buckets for the objects and players, and
            therefore completely separate view index update and structure without requiring to check
            the document type during progressing.</p>
<ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Use Built-in Reduce Functions</strong></li>

         </ul>
<p class="p">Where possible, use
               one of the supplied built-in reduce functions, <samp class="ph codeph">_sum</samp>,
               <samp class="ph codeph">_count</samp>](#couchbase-views-writing-reduce-count),
               <samp class="ph codeph">_stats</samp>](#couchbase-views-writing-reduce-stats).</p>
<p class="p">These
            functions are highly optimized. Using a custom reduce function requires additional
            processing and may impose additional build time on the production of the
         index.</p>
